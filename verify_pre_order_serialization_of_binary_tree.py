https://leetcode.com/problems/verify-preorder-serialization-of-a-binary-tree/

One way to serialize a binary tree is to use pre-order traversal. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as #.

     _9_
    /   \
   3     2
  / \   / \
 4   1  #  6
/ \ / \   / \
# # # #   # #
For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#", where # represents a null node.

Given a string of comma separated values, verify whether it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree. Find an algorithm without reconstructing the tree.

Each comma separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character '#' representing null pointer.

You may assume that the input format is always valid, for example it could never contain two consecutive commas such as "1,,3".

Example 1:

Input: "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: "1,#"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: "9,#,#,1"
Output: false

Strategy:

* Pre-Order is root, left, right
* If a serialization is valid it has the correct number of slots
* A null node takes up one slot
* A non-null node takes up one slot and opens up two slots (i.e. net of one)
* Check if total slots at the end is equal to 0
